                <p>Game Optimizations</p>
                <p>Created codes to model and solves popular games such as Sudoku, Connect Four, and Minesweeper. The Minesweeper interects direcetly with <a href="https://minesweeperonline.com/">minesweeper.com</a>.</p>
                <p>For interactive games like Minesweeper and Connect Four I utilized python and librarys such as pyguiauto. For stand alone games like sudoku C++ was used to fit time constraints.</p>
